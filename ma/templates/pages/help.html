							<p>
								Money management is one of the key skills we need to teach children. As children grow, they need to learn how to make smart decisions with money. It is only through work that we can teach children to understand the value money and not least, how money and work relate. It is true that financial habits and work practices formed early in life can influence behavior in adulthood.
